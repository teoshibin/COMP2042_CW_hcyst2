# Clashing Frogger
A refurbish version of an arcade game frogger in 1980s.

The main objective of the game is to guide numbers of frogs to their home at the top of the screen. 
The game begins with three, five, or seven frogs, depending on the difficulty and stage. 
Losing them all ends the game. 
There is a 4 direction joystick for the movement of the frog. 
Each push in a direction causes the frog to hop once in that direction.

[Back to content](#content)

## Implementations
### Views
Interactive screens are added using fxml and controllers to adhere MVC pattern.
#### GUI Hierarchy
- Username managing screen
    - Main menu screen
        - Game info screen
        - High score screen
        - Option settings screen
        - Level selection screen
            - game screen
            - victory screen

### Controllers
ScreenController class and ControlledScreen interface are introduced to eliminate many to many relationships between screens so that screens are handled in a centralized form with a relation of one to many.
This framework allows new fxml screens to be added easily.
#### Controllers Hierarchy
- Launcher (application)
    - ScreenController (main controller)
        - ControlledScreens (interface)
            - Controller1 (fxml controllers)
            - Controller2
            - ...

### Changes
- Removed Digit actor
- Removed Background actor and move its functionality to LoadComponents
- Added ConstantData class for game constants
- Added RuntimeData class for data references (game saves are loaded here)
- Added Game, ActorLoader, LevelSelector and Launcher, refactored from the original main class.
- Added LevelBase interface for linking up all custom-made levels.
- Added LevelNotFoundException a custom Exception class for error handling
- Added Sound class for audio clip playing and music playing
- Added SaveGameManager that extends FileManager for the use of loading and storing save file
- Added Player, SavedGame, settings as serializable data object 
- Added data access objects (DAO) for Player and assets
- Added assets.properties as central assets' path storage
- Categorized classes into package of controllers, core, utils and worlds
- Categorized asset files into directories of images, sounds, views (fxml assets) and styles (css)
- Refactored Actor class into IntersectingActor class, ActingActor class, AnimatingActor Interface
- Refactored Turtle, WetTurtle and Frog to extends ActingActor and implements AnimatingActor
- Refactored End actor to extends IntersectingActor and remove inherited unused methods
- Refactored the rest of the actors extend from ActingActor
- Refactored in game score display from image view appending to label updating
- Added GodAnimal actor that wins instantly for debugging purposes
- Added several fxml screens with its controller controlled by an instance of ScreenController in Launcher
- Slightly shrink down the size of the window

### Fixes
- Fixed actor image view inconsistent shifting due to different image size of different actors
- Fixed fast frog movement bug for long pressed key
- Fixed a bug where all wet turtles sink into water at the same time

## Design Patterns

<p align="center">
  <img src="UML/Package_frogger.png"  alt="Class Diagram"/>
</p>   

- **MVC Pattern**  
  Using models, views(fxml,css), controllers for the entire GUI

- **Front Controller Pattern**  
  ScreensController act as a centralized views request handling class and all other controllers are requested through ControlledClass Interface

- **Factory Pattern**  
  Used in level base (interface) and levels (class) where the interface act as the general level and levelSelector instantiate one of the level (sub-class) and cast it to level base

- **Singleton Pattern**  
  Used across this project such as Sound class, Convertor, Validator class etc.

- **Facade Pattern**  
  Used in the LoadComponents class, where it wraps a complicated subsystem (actors) with a simpler interface.
  
- **DAO Pattern**  
  SaveGame Data structure Loaded from save file act as the data, uses PlayerDao implemented by PlayerDaoImpl to fetch data from SavedGame Data Structure
